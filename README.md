# faunadb-http-dart

A basic communication library for interacting with FaunaDB using FQL in raw JSON

This is mostly for my own usage, so I don't have plans to implement comprehensive functionality. I am hoping for an official driver from the Fauna team (which is also why I didn't want to use a more apt library name like `faunadb`).
